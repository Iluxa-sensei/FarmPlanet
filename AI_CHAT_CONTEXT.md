# ü§ñ AI Chat Territory Context Feature

## Overview
The AI Chat page now supports selecting specific farm territories to provide personalized, context-aware advice based on your actual field data.

## Features

### 1. Territory Selection
- **Territory Dropdown**: Select any of your saved territories from the map
- **None Option**: Choose "None" for general farming advice without specific field context
- **Auto-load**: Territories are automatically loaded from localStorage when you open the chat

### 2. Context Information Display
When you select a territory, the AI assistant receives detailed context including:
- **Territory Name**: The name you gave to your field
- **Area**: Size of the field in hectares
- **Current Crop**: What crop is currently planted
- **Planting Date**: When the crop was planted
- **Days Since Planting**: Automatically calculated
- **Growing Season**: Current week out of total weeks in the AI plan
- **Expected Harvest**: Harvest date from the AI farming plan
- **Current Week Tasks**: Tasks scheduled for the current week

### 3. Visual Context Card
The "Active Context" card displays:
- üìç Territory name
- üåø Current crop with emoji
- üìè Field area in hectares
- üìÖ Planting date
- ü§ñ AI Plan status badge (if active)

### 4. Personalized AI Responses
With a territory selected, the AI assistant will:
- Provide advice specific to your crop type
- Consider the growth stage based on planting date
- Reference your field's size in recommendations
- Align suggestions with your AI farming plan tasks
- Give timeline-appropriate advice (e.g., when to fertilize, water, harvest)

## How It Works

### Backend Logic
1. **Load Territories**: On page load, territories are fetched from `localStorage`
2. **Build Context**: When a territory is selected, a context string is built with all relevant field data
3. **Enhanced Prompt**: The context is appended to the system prompt sent to OpenAI
4. **AI Processing**: GPT-4o-mini receives the enhanced prompt and provides personalized advice

### Data Flow
```
User selects territory 
  ‚Üí Territory data loaded from localStorage
  ‚Üí Context string built with field details
  ‚Üí Context added to system prompt
  ‚Üí OpenAI API called with enhanced prompt
  ‚Üí AI response considers specific field context
  ‚Üí User receives personalized advice
```

## Example Use Cases

### Without Territory Context
**User**: "When should I water my crops?"
**AI**: "Generally, water crops when the top 2-3 inches of soil feel dry..."

### With Territory Context (Wheat, 25 ha, Week 3)
**User**: "When should I water my crops?"
**AI**: "For your 25-hectare wheat field (planted 21 days ago, currently in Week 3), you should water when soil moisture drops below 60%. At this vegetative growth stage, wheat needs about 25-30mm of water per week. Given your field size, consider using center pivot irrigation for even coverage..."

## User Interface

### Territory Selector Card
- Located just below the page header
- Only appears if you have saved territories
- Clean, modern glass-card design
- Two-column layout: selector on left, context info on right

### Toast Notifications
- **Territory Activated**: "üåæ Territory Context Activated - AI will now provide personalized advice for [Territory Name]"
- **General Mode**: "üåç General Mode - AI will provide general farming advice"

## Technical Details

### State Management
```typescript
const [territories, setTerritories] = useState<Territory[]>([]);
const [selectedTerritoryId, setSelectedTerritoryId] = useState<string>('');
```

### Context Building
The `buildTerritoryContext()` function creates a structured context string:
```typescript
üìç SELECTED TERRITORY CONTEXT:
- Name: North Field
- Area: 25.43 hectares
- Current Crop: üåæ Wheat
- Planting Date: 1/15/2025
- Days Since Planting: 21 days
- Growing Season: Week 3 of 16
- Expected Harvest: 5/15/2025
- Current Week Tasks: Apply nitrogen fertilizer, Monitor for pests, Check soil moisture

Use this context to provide personalized advice for this specific field.
```

### API Integration
The context is seamlessly integrated into the OpenAI system prompt:
```typescript
const systemMessage = `You are an expert agricultural AI assistant...
${territoryContext}`;
```

## Benefits

1. **Precision Advice**: Get recommendations tailored to your specific crop, growth stage, and field size
2. **Timeline Awareness**: AI knows exactly where you are in the growing season
3. **Task Alignment**: Suggestions align with your AI farming plan tasks
4. **Data-Driven**: Uses your actual field data, not generic assumptions
5. **Easy Switching**: Quickly switch between territories or general mode
6. **Visual Clarity**: See exactly what context the AI is using

## Future Enhancements (Potential)
- Weather integration: Add current weather conditions to context
- Soil data: Include soil type and test results
- Historical data: Reference past crop yields and issues
- Multi-territory: Ask questions about multiple fields at once
- Conversation memory: Remember previous questions about the same territory

## Tips for Best Results

1. **Be Specific**: Ask questions related to your selected territory for best results
2. **Use Context**: Reference your field name in questions (e.g., "How is North Field doing?")
3. **Follow Tasks**: Ask about current week tasks from your AI plan
4. **Switch Territories**: Change territories when asking about different fields
5. **General Mode**: Use "None" when asking general farming questions

## Storage
- Territory data is stored in localStorage under key: `farmplanet_territories`
- Chat history is stored separately in: `farmplanet_chat_history`
- Context is rebuilt fresh on each message to ensure accuracy

**Note**: This feature requires territories to be created on the Map page first. Draw your fields, add crop details, and generate AI plans to get the most value from context-aware AI chat.
